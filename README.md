# Face-Recognition-and-Varification-System
This project has two notebooks, and one is Face Verification Model and the other one is the Face Recognition model.  In the face verification model, the model takes the names as identity and  the image of that person who wants to enter the office building and model verifies that they are who they claim to be by matching the database. In the face verification model, the model takes only an image of the person who wants to enter the office building, then the system figures out if it is one of the authorized persons or not for entry. In this system, we use the faceNet pre-trained model that is trained on inceptionV3 architecture and a one-shot learning technique.
